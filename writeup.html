        <h2>Comparing the performance of Australian Open players from 2004 - 2014</h2>
        <p>Over a decade from 2004 - 2014, a little over 250 players have played in the Australian Open. I have attempted to analyze this data to identify interesting statistics and compare performance. </p>
        <p><i>Design rationale and interactivity:</i><br>
            My main focus was on identifying the best players and an analysis of their performance, hence I started off with a simple bar chart sorted by players with the most wins. This immediately shows a couple of things - the best players to play the Open and the players with the longest longevity. The sorted bar chart is paginated as well, with 10 players shown per page. In addition, data has been aggregated and some interesting overall stats identified and displayed. 
            <br>
        Each bar in the chart is clickable, which links to a player profile page showing the players performance and statistics over the years. 
        </p>
        <p>The player profile page has a couple of different analyses by default - analysis of their statistics, as well as performance over the years they participated in the Open. 
            <ol>
                <li>Analysis of statistics:
                    <ol>
                        <li>For this, I have considered the stats that reflect consistency rather than individual moments of brilliance. As such, I have considered first serve convert percentage, first serve points won, second serve points won, break percentage, return percentage and net points won in this analysis.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also compiled the average statistics of those performance metrics, taking into account all performances of all players who played in the Open in that decade. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A grouped bar chart was used to compare these statistics.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Year-wise performance:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Another useful statistic is to quantify the progression of these players over the years, by figuring out the rounds they played. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This was achieved through a horizontal bar chart. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another useful analysis is comparing the player with the performance of another player. This can show the gulf in class between players, or conversely, the small margins that differentiate a player from a champion. 
            <br>
            For this, a dropdown list with all players was made available, and the performances are compared using a radar chart with the above performance metrics.
        </p>
        <p><i>Final thoughts:</i><br>
            This is a solid analysis of player performance over the years in Australian Open, utilizing charts and plots to visually determine the best players over the years. The statistics of the best players are influenced by both their consistent performance in matches in addition to their longevity. Hence there is no surprise the so-called Big 3, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, dominate the statistics with them occupying the top 3 spots in most matches won, and being the best in terms of most statistics as well with their radar charts covering the most area.
